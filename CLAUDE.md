# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **data repository** (not a code project) containing nanopublications created by three specialized bots. Nanopublications are minimalist semantic publications in RDF Trig format, cryptographically signed with RSA keys. There are no build, test, or lint commands.

The project creator is Tobias Kuhn (ORCID: 0000-0002-1267-0234).

## Repository Structure

Each bot has its own directory with a consistent layout:
- `examples/` — reference nanopublication showing expected structure
- `output/` — generated unsigned nanopublications
- `signed/` — cryptographically signed versions (ready for publishing)
- `README.md` — bot IRI and key file location

### Bots

| Bot | Domain | Key File |
|---|---|---|
| `doibot` | Academic papers (via DOI/Crossref) | `~/.nanopub/doibot_id_rsa` |
| `biodivbot` | Organism-environment associations (BioLink, ENVO, UBERON ontologies) | `~/.nanopub/biodivbot_id_rsa` |
| `ai-in-edu-bot` | AI approaches in education research | `~/.nanopub/ai-in-edu-bot_id` |

## Nanopublication Structure

Every nanopub (`.trig` file) contains four named graphs:
1. **Head** — links to the other three graphs
2. **Assertion** — the semantic claims (domain-specific RDF triples)
3. **Provenance** — attribution and source references
4. **PublicationInfo** — metadata, bot identity, and RSA signature (in signed versions)

The `plain.introtemplate.trig` at the repo root is a template for introducing new bots to the nanopub network.
