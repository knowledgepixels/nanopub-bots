# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **data repository** containing nanopublications created by three specialized bots. Nanopublications are minimalist semantic publications in RDF Trig format, cryptographically signed with RSA keys.

The project creator is Tobias Kuhn (ORCID: 0000-0002-1267-0234).

## Repository Structure

Each bot has its own directory with a consistent layout:
- `examples/` — reference nanopublication showing expected structure
- `output/` — generated unsigned nanopublications
- `signed/` — cryptographically signed versions (ready for publishing)
- `README.md` — bot IRI and key file location

### Bots

| Bot | Domain | Key File |
|---|---|---|
| `doibot` | Academic papers (via DOI/Crossref) | `~/.nanopub/doibot_id_rsa` |
| `biodivbot` | Organism-environment associations (BioLink, ENVO, UBERON ontologies) | `~/.nanopub/biodivbot_id_rsa` |
| `ai-in-edu-bot` | AI approaches in education research | `~/.nanopub/ai-in-edu-bot_id_rsa` |

## Nanopublication Structure

Every nanopub (`.trig` file) contains four named graphs:
1. **Head** — links to the other three graphs
2. **Assertion** — the semantic claims (domain-specific RDF triples)
3. **Provenance** — attribution and source references
4. **PublicationInfo** — metadata, bot identity, and RSA signature (in signed versions)

The `plain.introtemplate.trig` at the repo root is a template for introducing new bots to the nanopub network.

## nanopub-java CLI

The `./np` wrapper script runs the nanopub-java CLI from the sibling `../nanopub-java` repo. If the JAR isn't built yet:

```bash
mvn -f ../nanopub-java clean package -DskipTests
```

### Key commands

```bash
./np sign <file.trig>                    # Sign a nanopub (uses ~/.nanopub/id_rsa by default)
./np sign -k ~/.nanopub/doibot_id_rsa <file.trig>   # Sign with a specific bot key
./np publish <signed.trig>               # Publish to the nanopub network
./np check <file.trig>                   # Validate a nanopub
./np retract -i <nanopub-uri-or-file>    # Create a retraction nanopub
./np retract -i <nanopub-uri> -p         # Retract and publish the retraction
```

### Superseding nanopublications

To publish an updated version of a nanopub, add an `npx:supersedes` triple in the `pubinfo` graph pointing to the old nanopub's URI:

```turtle
this:pubinfo {
  this: ...
    npx:supersedes <https://w3id.org/np/RAold...> ;
    ...
}
```

Then sign and publish the new nanopub. The old one remains immutable on the network but is marked as superseded.

For index nanopubs, `mkindex -x <old-index-uri>` adds the supersedes link automatically:

```bash
./np mkindex -x <old-index-uri> -o new-index.trig -t "Title" file1.trig file2.trig
```

## Workflow: creating/updating nanopubs

1. Edit the output file in `<bot>/output/`
2. Sign: `./np sign -k <key-file> <bot>/output/<name>.trig -o <bot>/signed/signed.<name>.trig`
3. Publish: `./np publish <bot>/signed/signed.<name>.trig`

When updating an existing nanopub, add `npx:supersedes` in the output file's pubinfo graph pointing to the old signed URI before re-signing.

### Temp URI prefix

Output files **must** use `@prefix : <http://purl.org/nanopub/temp/np1/> .` as the base prefix. This is the standard nanopub temp URI that gets replaced with a proper trusty URI (`https://w3id.org/np/RA...`) during signing. Using `<https://w3id.org/np/temp>` instead causes the signed URI to incorrectly contain `/temp/`.
